- Sawtooth Issue:

# Summary
[summary]: #summary

This RFC proposes a Sawtooth SDK for Swift to enable development of
client-side Cocoa/Cocoa Touch applications. It should be modeled after
existing SDKs, implementing a SawtoothSigning module that provides methods
to generate private/public key pairs and sign transactions. A separate
repository should be created to host the Swift SDK.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

As interest in Sawtooth grows, it continues to be important to provide robust
SDKs to enable developers to innovate on the platform. Since iOS is one of the
most popular application platforms, it is crucial to extend Sawtooth to support
native iOS application development.

Additionally, the introduction of Hyperledger Grid has expanded the
possibility for supply chain use cases for the Sawtooth platform. Many of
these use cases may be well suited to mobile clients, allowing on-site
professionals at manufacturing or logistics facilities to interact with a
Sawtooth application.

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

The Swift SDK works similarly to existing SDKs. It provides a
SawtoothSigning module that supports generating private/public key pairs and
signing transactions. This module facilitates signing transactions in a way
that is compatible with Sawtooth requirements.

The Swift SDK proposed here does not currently implement a module to assist
with the creation of transaction processors, as the initial purpose is to
support front-end application development.

### Capabilities

- Generate private/public key pairs
- Sign transactions
- Verify signatures

###### Example
```
import SawtoothSigning

let context = Secp256k1Context()
let privateKey = context.newRandomPrivateKey()
let signer = Signer(context: context, privateKey: privateKey)
let signature = signer.sign(data: message_bytes)
context.verify(signature: signature, data: message_bytes,
publicKey: signer.getPublicKey())
```

# Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

An initial implementation of the SawtoothSigning framework has already been
written. The code can be found at
[bitwiseio/sawtooth-sdk-swift](https://github.com/bitwiseio/sawtooth-sdk-swift).
The repository also contains documentation explaining how to use the
SawtoothSigning framework and a working example of the framework in use by an
iOS client for the
[xo transaction family](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/transaction_family_specifications/xo_transaction_family.html).

### Dependencies

### Importing the SawtoothSigning framework
The Swift SDK's SawtoothSigning module can be imported to a Cocoa/Cocoa Touch
project via [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), a dependency
manager for Cocoa applications.

1. Install Carthage using
[these installation instructions](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage).

2. Create a Cartfile in the same directory as your `.xcodeproj` or
`.xcworkspace`.

3. In the Cartfile for your project, add:
   ```
   github "bitwiseio/sawtooth-sdk-swift" "master"
   ```

4. Run `carthage update`.

   After the framework is downloaded and built, it can be found at `path/to/your/project/Carthage/Build/<platform>/SawtoothSigning.framework`

5. Add the built .framework binaries to the "Embedded Binaries" and
"LinkedFrameworks and Libraries" sections in your Xcode project.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

There are no known drawbacks for this addition, besides the maintenance of an
additional SDK. No existing features or repositories will be changed.

# Rationale and alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

The Sawtooth Swift SDK is modeled after the existing SDKs, with similar 
classes and methods. Developers who are already familiar with other Sawtooth
SDKs and Swift will be able to use the Swift SDK with minimal learning
friction.

#### Objective-C SDK

An SDK that supports Cocoa/Cocoa Touch Applications could also be written in
Objective-C. In spite of Objective-C being an older language with many
feature-rich APIs, Swift is a better choice for a couple of reasons:

- Swift has a simpler syntax and is easier to learn, which makes code easier
  to read and write.
- Using Swift makes it possible to export the SawtoothSigning module as a
  dynamic framework rather than a static library. Dynamic frameworks reduce
  the launch time of apps and their memory footprints when compared to static
  libraries. Using SawtoothSigning as a dynamic framework allows developers
  to use Carthage to download and build the module directly from the GitHub
  repository.

#### Use existing functionality

Without the Swift SDK, developers have two options to write an iOS-compatible 
Sawtooth client:
- Create a web app using the Javascript SDK
- Implement custom methods to create and sign transactions natively

The first solution does not work for a use case that requires a native
application. The second solution raises the barrier of entry for developers
with a background in mobile development who want to use Sawtooth. The creation
of the Sawtooth Swift SDK, including documentation and examples, will make the
Sawtooth platform more accessible to those coming from mobile development.

# Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

The implementation of the SawtoothSigning module for the Swift SDK is based
on existing implementations for other languages, such as 
[Java](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-sdk-java/tree/master/sawtooth-sdk-signing/src/main/java/sawtooth/sdk/signing) 
and
[Rust](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-sdk-rust/blob/master/src/signing/secp256k1.rs).

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

### To be implemented

- Once the Swift SDK repository exists under the Hyperledger organization,
  the existing Cartfile in the XO example will need to be updated to the new
  path of the SDK. The documentation will also need updated instructions on
  how to import the SawtoothSigning framework from the new repository.

- The Sawtooth protos are not included in the initial implementation of the
  Swift SDK. In order to create a Sawtooth application, developers will have 
  to copy the Sawtooth `.proto` files into the application and use a Swift
  protogen script to manually generate the protobuf messages. The XO client
  example provides an example of this.

  If we want to include the Sawtooth protos as part of the SDK, further work
  will have to be done to implement protogen functionality in the framework.

### Other issues

- The documentation for the Swift SDK will need to be included in the
  Sawtooth Core documentation under the Application Developer's Guide.
  Currently, there is not a satisfactory approach to integrate SDK
  documentation into the Sawtooth Core documentation, given that the source
  files and code base are in a different repository than the Sawtooth
  documentation.
